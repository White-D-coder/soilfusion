## 1. Problem Statement


### Problem Title

Soil Health Dashboard from Sensor Logs

Problem Description
Modern farms increasingly use IoT sensors to monitor soil parameters such as moisture, pH, nitrogen levels, and temperature. These sensors continuously generate large volumes of data, typically stored as raw CSV logs. While this data is abundant, it often lacks meaningful interpretation, creating an intelligence gap between data collection and real agricultural decisions.
Farmers are surrounded by numbers but lack the tools to convert those numbers into clear, actionable insights about soil health, irrigation timing, and planting decisions.


| Challenge                                   | Description                                                                                      | Impact on Farmers                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Raw Data Liability ("So What?" Problem)** | A sensor reading such as **Moisture: 15.2%** is just a number without context or interpretation. | Farmers cannot easily determine whether irrigation should happen now or later.       |
| **Human Interpretation Burden**             | Raw sensor logs require manual analysis to understand soil conditions.                           | Farmers must spend time interpreting data instead of focusing on farming activities. |
| **Snapshot vs Story Problem**               | Most tools only show the current soil reading instead of long-term soil trends.                  | Slow soil degradation or nutrient depletion may go unnoticed.                        |
| **Missing Historical Correlation**          | Current systems rarely correlate live soil conditions with historical crop yield data.           | Farmers cannot learn from past harvest outcomes to improve future decisions.         |
| **Alert Fatigue ("Cry Wolf" Problem)**      | Sensors operating in harsh environments may produce temporary spikes or noise in readings.       | Frequent false alerts reduce trust in the monitoring system.                         |
| **Decision Paralysis**                      | Farming decisions such as planting or irrigation depend heavily on correct timing.               | Without clear insights, farmers rely on intuition instead of data-driven decisions.  |
